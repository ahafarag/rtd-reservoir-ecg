> ‚ö†Ô∏è **This repository contains academic research code provided under the [MIT License](LICENSE).**

## üß† Project Overview

This project demonstrates a **nonlinear time-series modeling approach** for ECG signals using a multi-RTD (Resonant Tunneling Diode) inspired **Reservoir Computing (RC)** framework. It is designed as a potential master's thesis topic or educational showcase combining:

- Neuromorphic computing concepts
- Signal processing for biomedical data
- Streamlit for simulation interface
- Python/ML stack (scikit-learn, pandas, matplotlib)

> **Keywords:** Reservoir Computing, RTD, ECG Prediction, MLP/Ridge Readout, Time Series, Biomedical Signal Simulation

## üìà Motivation

Electrocardiogram (ECG) signal prediction is a critical task in biomedical diagnostics. Traditional ML approaches require heavy feature engineering and large datasets.

Reservoir Computing (RC) offers:

- Rapid convergence
- High performance on chaotic/time-dependent systems
- Compatibility with analog/hardware implementations via RTDs

We propose a model that uses **multiple parallel reservoirs** (emulating RTDs) to capture rich temporal dynamics.


## üß™ Methodology

The main simulation pipeline:

```
Raw ECG ‚ûù Normalize ‚ûù [RTD Reservoir 1]
                        ‚ûù [RTD Reservoir 2]   ‚ûù Concatenate ‚ûù MLP/Ridge ‚ûù Predict ECG
                        ‚ûù [RTD Reservoir 3]
```

Each RTD unit applies a nonlinear transformation with leaky integration and delay. Their states are concatenated and passed to a trainable readout.


## üßÆ Mathematical Formulation

Reservoir state update per unit:

$$
\mathbf{x}_t = (1 - \alpha) \mathbf{x}_{t-1} + \alpha \cdot \tanh(\mathbf{W}_{in} u_{t-d})
$$

Readout:

- **MLP:** Multi-layer Perceptron with backpropagation
- **Ridge Regression:** \( \mathbf{W}_{out} = (X^TX + \lambda I)^{-1} X^T Y \)

Prediction:

$$
\hat{y}_t = \mathbf{W}_{out} \cdot \mathbf{x}_t
$$


## üìä Sample Results

| Metric       | Value    |
|--------------|----------|
| **Accuracy** | 99.46%   |
| **R¬≤ Score** | 0.9948   |
| **MAE**      | 0.0453   |
| **RMSE**     | 0.0724   |
| **MAPE**     | 3.10%    |
